## Course Guide

### Introduction

This organization serves as the central point for the course on Healthcare Services Architectures. Here you’ll find original repositories and forks relevant to the course. They can provide support for labs or examples related to the technologies we will use.

### Course objectives

The main goal of this course is to give students a deep understanding of the architecture, design, development, and integration of information systems in the healthcare domain.  
You will learn to apply principles of SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture) and BPM (Business Process Management) to build robust, scalable, and interoperable solutions that meet the needs of the health sector.

### Key technologies

Throughout the course, we will work with the following technologies:

- **WSO2 Identity Server:** An identity and access management platform to secure access to resources. We will learn to configure authentication and authorization using Identity Server.
- **Apache Camel:** Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) technology for developing orchestration services.
- **Apache KIE:** Open-source initiative for developing BPM solutions.
- **Apache Kafka:** Event broker for building Event-Driven Architectures (EDA).
- **Spring Boot:** Framework for developing Java applications.
